print("Imagine waking up one day, looking back, and realizing that the dreams you once had—the goals you were so passionate about—are now out of reach. Not because you weren’t capable, but because you let time slip by. The opportunities you once had have passed, the potential you had has dimmed, and the person you could have become is just a shadow in your mind. The only thing left is the regret of knowing you had all the tools to succeed but chose comfort and distraction over growth and achievement. The world moves on, and so do the people who once believed in you. The harsh truth is, life doesn’t wait, and neither do your dreams. If you don't work for them now, one day they might become just that—dreams that never turned into reality.")
print("Don't be harsh on yourself so much that you give up on your dreams no matter what ")
